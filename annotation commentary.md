The Annotation sourced here discusses the interesting developments for the way that the digitization of history and historical documents allow access to wider selections of historical documents to be accessible for more general research and viewing that do not require in person access as traditionally needed. This increase that the access to historical documentation provide does as the annotation states an potential for a wider selection of documents to be easily accessible for use in papers, but also allows for people to have a greater selection of documents to choose from if a person wants to choose specific documents for an argument. This means that as a responsible historian when researching secondary sources and reading papers, researching the sources and any known biases of the author. Beyond this making research for new work substantially easier it also allows for further research on older documents to reference and research sources that were once inaccessible furthering on the long time habit that many people have of once reading and article or paper and then taking its sources and researching them to enhance that paper and your own research. This need to be more critical in reading of articles and papers to ensure that it presents a balanced article or if not that you are aware of the bias that it holds and therefore are able to find opposing views to build a more complete picture
