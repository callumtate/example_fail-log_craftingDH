# Fail log for the first week of class 

Slightly lost as to what is neede to put in here 

## First Annotation

[First Annotation](https://hyp.is/_vbYHHWvEemvAtMrb5lpuA/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/)  the First Annotation was one of the mandatory but still presented a challange as despite the usefullness of hypothosis the fact that there plugin is only available for one browser is annoyingif you dont use that browserand thus added a few extra hurdles.

## Second Annotation

[Second Annotation](https://hyp.is/EZ5VjHW4EemEqxM_1nLyOQ/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) This second one Relates to my confusion as to wether these logs in github are also the weekly notebook pages or if we are supposed to be collecting our hypothosis annotations somewhere else for this purpose. Especially as working through this it quickly seemed that on pages with alot of annotations it is easy for yours to dissapear in the crowd even using just the classes group.

## Third Point 

was more just corious if all of the required readings will be articles linked externally as those are or if there will be more of a mix with articles through the carleton library
